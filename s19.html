        <p align = "left" style ="color:black;font-size:18px;"><br>The City of Guelph is a large community focused on integrity,
          excellence, and wellness. A municipality with many departments, Guelph’s City Hall is located on
          1 Carden Street, which accommodates Accessibility – my department – Planning, Transportation, and
          many more. <br><br>With Guelph’s main goal being supporting the people, their slogan is “Making a Difference”
          and that’s what they strive to do in every department. With the AODA web content compliance date coming up
          in 2021, Guelph is one of the municipalities that is ahead of the game.</p>

        <p align = "left" style ="color:white;font-size:18px;">As an Accessibility Assistant for City of Guelph’s
          Accessible Web Content project it was my job to assist the only other person on the project
          (my supervisor). With a website of over 4000 pages, and over 6000 documents this is a very large
          project for only two people! When I had started at the City of Guelph the project had just began
          and it didn’t really have a solid plan or direction. With my supervisor, Leanne, we sat down and
          gave the project direction, goals, and a solid plan. I had several tasks that reached across the board,
          some these include:</p>

                accessible web concepts, difficult pdf functions and tools, and
                formatting word documents to be accessible. One of my goals was to
                be able to communicate these concepts in a comprehensive way without
                 sounding condescending. I was able to confidently explain these
                 concepts to people and received positive feedback on my ability to
                 explain them. I learned that it is very important to be thorough,
                 understanding of someone's skill level, and patient when helping people.</p>

                 the task to create a Gantt chart template for the project as a whole and broke it up
                 further by making Gantt charts for individual departments in order to keep track of the
                 little details as well. During this time we worked with several departments simultaneously
                  and tracking and managing them was very important. I was able to really understand how much
                   work, time, and organization goes into managing projects.</p>

                 view technology with the barriers that some people may face. My 4 months in
                  the Accessibility Assistant position has given me the ability to look at
                   technology and see these barriers on a daily basis, and my part in making
                   it accessible. I was afforded the opportunity to attend Guelph Accessibility
                   Conference where I heard from many speakers and learned about AI technology
                   and its part in Accessibility. I was also able to learn all about Accessible
                    Web design and how a little extra effort can go a long way. I can now confidently
                    say my perspective in my everyday life has changed and I encourage my friends
                    to do their part by making any programs they produce accessible. I was able to
                     make my co-op report website accessible because of the things I learned.</p>

                While in this position I wanted to have a deep understanding of accessibility
                issues, web accessibility, and my part in it all. I was able to learn all about
                 accessibility in Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat Pro, websites, and using Quality
                 Assurance tools like Siteimprove. If anyone had issues with any of their
                 documents, they would come to me for help. I was tasked with creating training
                  courses for staff, where I learned about the software’s more in depth,
                  discovered issues and searched for solutions, and delivered training to staff.
                   When delivering the training people came up with issues and questions that
                   I didn't often come across but was able to solve within a few minutes due to my
                  understanding of the software and accessibility.</p>

        Assistant at the City of Guelph was an opportunity I will forever be grateful for. I was able to
        understand other perspectives, do meaningful work, and learn many valuable soft and technical skills.
        The things I learned while working on this project will propel me further into my career with a unique
