        <p align = "left" style ="color:black;font-size:18px;"><br>Guelph Water Services supplies safe and clean water to
          the residents of Guelph. With over 30 Water pumping and distribution stations Guelph Water services works day and
          night to ensure the quality and quantity of water that reaches our residents meets our standards.</p>
          <p align = "centre" style ="color:black;font-size:18px;">Fun fact: Guelph is one of the largest Canadian cities
            to rely almost exclusively on groundwater for its drinking supply!</p>

                   to ensure water comes out of your kitchen sink! We have operators, compliance, conservation,
                   the SCADA team, and a whole lot of other groups that ensure water reaches your business or
                   home.<br><br> I was welcomed onto the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) team with open arms. Our role at the city of
                  Guelph is to provide programs that automate the stations, provide interfaces that allow people to operate
                  stations remotely and view data and troubleshoot the system if something goes wrong.</p>

              <p align = "left" style = "color: black">During this Co-op I was
                tasked with programming the automation code for our Helmar site
                using an Allen Bradley SLC 500 and Ladder Logic Programming.
                This was something I had never done before and had no knowledge
                of prior to my co-op. Because this was something entirely new to
                 me one of my goals was to learn and be confident in programming
                 an Allen Bradley PLC. While I would have liked to program more
                 than one site, projects are always longer than they are expected.
                 I can now confidently say that I am much more confident in Ladder
                 Logic programming and programming for automation. While this was a
                 pretty tough task, I was able to step out of my comfort zone to
                 ask questions, understand the concepts, and get the job done.</p>

                Another one of my goals was to learn more about best coding practices
                and adhering to company standards. I found this to be a very
                important aspect of my job as it allowed others to understand
                what my code was doing and what I was thinking. This made it a
                lot easier for others to help me when I was stuck. I was able to
                really understand the importance of following standards when I
                was met with the task to create a company standard for our touchscreen
                 displays. At the end of my co-op term I was able to easily
                 pick out things that did not match our standards and fix them
                 right away.</p>

              <p align = "left" style = "color: black">From this Co-op, I wanted
                to gain knowledge in and understand how to read and use P&IDs
                 (Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams). It is important as a
                 programmer to understand how the system you are programming
                 works. P&IDs are a very important tool to understand process
                 systems. To learn how they work I was able to walk around a
                 site with the P&ID in hand and figure out how it works. While
                 I struggled with this in the beginning it became clearer as a
                 dove deeper into my work. While I was creating my Process
                 Control Narrative I looked at the P&ID to understand the
                 station and learn more about P&IDs. I can now understand what
                 a system is doing and how it operates by looking solely at its P&ID.</p>

                During this Co-op I also wanted to be able to write comprehensive
                control system functional specifications, like process control
                narratives (PCN). Along with the station I programmed I was
                tasked with writing the Process Control Narrative prior to
                programming it. With the help of my supervisor I was able to
                comprehensibly understand the system I was to program, the
                specifications of the equipment, and write it in a way that was
                comprehensive and would assist in programming. I was also tasked
                 with updating our current Process control Narrative template to
                  be up to our standards. I can confidently say that I am
                  confident in writing a structured and comprehensive Process
                  Control Narrative. </p>

          as a SCADA Developer Co-op at Guelph Water Services was a wonderful

          and very beneficial to my academic and personal growth.</p>

          thanks to my SCADA team for making this co-op term as great as it was!
          To Graham Nasby, who taught me everything I needed to know, and more. To
          Richard for always being a chair swivel away from the answer to my questions.
          To Sahil, my co-op counterpart, for navigating a new job with me.
          And last but not least, I owe a big thanks to the entire tech trailer for the
          fun and light-hearted environment! <br><br>
