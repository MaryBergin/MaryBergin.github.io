                Throughout the past 4 months I was able to plan out my individual
                days and weeks according to the work that I had to do and deadlines
                 coming up. Every Monday I took a look at my calendar and
                 upcoming due dates to plan the week. I was then able to
                 individually plan each day and work towards the deadlines I set
                  for myself. This self-organization was really important as I
                  often struggle with time management. Planning the weeks and days
                  allowed me to have specific things to work towards. I found that
                  I was successful in managing my time effectively.</p>

                A lot of the work I did in this role was focused on writing content
                and reports on my research. In the past four months I was able
                to produce useful and well written documents with the help of my
                supervisor. After producing something I was able to get feedback
                and make the needed changes to improve my writing. I also
                produced a document for the co-op student that would come after
                me to introduce them to the role and things they should be
                doing. I was successful in achieving this goal, but it was
                identified that I need to work on my proof reading to ensure
                that everything is spelt correctly.</p>

                 about the language. I was tasked with creating content for the
                 School of Computer Science Website as well as making sure that
                 the flow of the site and its components made sense. In the
                 beginning I ran into a few issues with more complicated page
                 layouts, but I was able to reach out for help and achieve the
                 layout I wanted. During the second half of my co-op work term,
                 I was much more confident in Drupal 7 and I didnâ€™t have to ask
                 for help when creating, editing, or removing content from the website.
                 I successfully completed my goal and learned a lot about Drupal 7.</p>

          as the School of Computer Science Recruitment and Liaison Support Co-op
           was a wonderful opportunity. I was given the opportunity to really
           work on my non-technical skills as well as some technical ones. It
           was very interesting to see the inner workings of my School. I was
           able to gain insights about the recruitment process and obtain contacts
           that will help me further with my degree and the school clubs that I
           lead. This experience was very beneficial and a great opportunity I

          this work term a great one! </p>
