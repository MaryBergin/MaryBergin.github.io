                I was tasked with managing our backlog of bugs and features to be implemented.
                 As someone who was relatively new to C# programming, working on such a 
                 large software was a little intimidating. One of my goals was to become 
                 proficient in C# programming. Working on bugs was a great opportunity to 
                 get a more in-depth understanding of the code base as well as the use of C#. 
                 I was able to explore different areas of the code, look for interactions 
                 between different pieces, and work with software hands on. In understanding 
                 such a large code base, I was able to reach out to members of my team with 
                 any issues or roadblocks I faced. At the end of this Co-op I had a much greater
                  understanding of C#, and while I may not be proficient I am definitely on my way there.</p>

                TransPlus utilizes SQL for their database of fleets and one of my goals was to 
                become more comfortable using SQL. During my work term I was given the opportunity 
                to utilize my previous experience and knowledge as well as gain confidence and 
                experience working with a large database in SQL. Through defect fixing I learned a 
                lot about querying and manipulating data, as the database was a key element for 
                information on the functionality of certain features.</p>

                I found at the beginning of my co-op identifying the area of a defect was difficult. 
                I made it one of my goals to be able to become more efficient in finding and 
                eliminating bugs. I thought working with a large codebase would be a great opportunity 
                to really work on my bug fixing skills. After getting a better understanding of the 
                Software it was easier to identify the general area the defect was in, but with some 
                practice and help from my team members, I was able to locate the defects in the code 
                much faster. With the understanding of the software came a better understanding about 
                how to fix defects, however I think there was still some room for improvement.</p>

                During this Co-op I also wanted to be able to write comprehensive
                control system functional specifications, like process control
                narratives (PCN). Along with the station I programmed I was
                tasked with writing the Process Control Narrative prior to
                programming it. With the help of my supervisor I was able to
                comprehensibly understand the system I was to program, the
                specifications of the equipment, and write it in a way that was
                comprehensive and would assist in programming. I was also tasked
                 with updating our current Process control Narrative template to
                  be up to our standards. I can confidently say that I am
                  confident in writing a structured and comprehensive Process
                  Control Narrative. </p>
